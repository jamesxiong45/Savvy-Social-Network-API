# Savvy-Social-Network-API

## Description

The goal for this project was to create a functioning Social Networking API using CRUD operations through Insomnia! In this application, we can create/remove users using an email, username, and password basis.
These users can then add/remove other users as friends, post/remove thoughts and add/remove reactions to these thoughts.

## Usage

This app was created through mainly javascript and utilizes Express.js, Mongoose, Insomnia and MongoDB!

* First, clone the files into a directory.

* Then, go into your terminal and run `npm i` to install node.js and the dependencies.

* After that, run `node utils/seed.js` to seed users into the database.

* Next, run `node index.js` within the root of the directory to start the server.

* Finally, you can run Insomnia or MongoDB to create/remove users, create/remove thoughts, add/remove friends, and add/remove reactions.
